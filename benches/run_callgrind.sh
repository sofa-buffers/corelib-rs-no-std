# SofaBuffers Rust (no_std) — machine-independent instruction cost.
#
# Runs each benchmark workload once under Callgrind and reports instructions
# retired per operation (Ir/op). Unlike wall-clock or CPU time, instruction
# counts are deterministic and independent of the host's clock speed and
# scheduler, so the numbers compare across machines (and against the C/C++/Go/
# Python/TypeScript tools — the workloads, ids and values are identical).
#
# The bench binary exposes each workload as a `#[inline(never)]`,
# `#[unsafe(no_mangle)]` `run_<workload>` function that performs exactly one op;
# `--collect-atstart=no --toggle-collect=run_<workload>` therefore measures a
# single op's Ir directly (no rep-count subtraction needed — native symbols,
# unlike the JIT/interpreted ports).
#
# Prereqs: valgrind, cargo. This builds the bench binary if missing.
# Usage:   bash benches/run_callgrind.sh
