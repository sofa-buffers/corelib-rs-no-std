//! Wrapper-array slots for generated decode destinations — the **support
//! layer** beside the codec, not the codec.
//!
//! Nothing here touches the wire. These are the operations a generated visitor
//! performs *around* a [`Visitor`](crate::Visitor) callback when the scope it is
//! in is a wrapper array (MESSAGE_SPEC §5.1): check an element id or an announced
//! length against the bound that governs it, and make the slot an element lands
//! in. Every one of them has the same shape for every schema — the bound arrives
//! as an argument, the element type as a type parameter, the element default as
//! that type's [`Default`] — which is why they live here once instead of being
//! emitted, rationale and all, into every generated crate (generator#587,
//! ARCHITECTURE §8).
//!
//! `corelib-rs` and `corelib-rs-no-std` carry this module with the same API,
//! the same semantics and the same name, `sofab::seq`: they are two builds of
//! one design, and generated code moves between them unchanged.
//!
//! # Three reservations, one shape
//!
//! Every wrapper array a schema can declare reaches this module through one of
//! three calls, which differ only in what a slot holds:
//!
//! * [`place_elem`] puts a decoded `string` / `blob` element at the index its id
//!   names;
//! * [`reserve_elem`] makes the slot a `struct`, `union` or nested-array element
//!   is routed into, and hands it back. The helper owns the growth and the bound;
//!   the generated code keeps the routing — it records the index and sends the
//!   element's own fields there;
//! * [`reserve_row`] does the same for a matrix row and empties it, because the
//!   array wrapper *replaces* (MESSAGE_SPEC §7.4).
//!
//! [`check_index`] and [`check_len`] are the comparisons on their own, for the
//! places that decide before a slot exists: the length word of a `string` /
//! `blob` element (`Visitor::fixlen_begin`), and the row id and element count of
//! a matrix row.
//!
//! # The index rules
//!
//! Four rules hold for any element type, and nothing in the shared vectors can
//! tell an implementation that breaks them from one that does not — they are
//! properties of the *decoded value*, not of the bytes, which is why
//! CORELIB_PLAN §7.2 item 8 asks for them separately:
//!
//! * **Gaps are legal.** An interior element equal to its default is not
//!   written at all, so ids `0, 2, 3` are well-formed. The missing index is
//!   filled with the element default — a fresh `Default::default()` per slot, so
//!   no two struct elements ever share state — and never skipped over: every
//!   element after a gap keeps its index.
//! * **Length is highest present id + 1.** The wrapper carries no length and the
//!   last element is never elided, so growing to `id + 1` is exactly right and
//!   no trailing fill is ever needed. A schema `count` is a **capacity**, not a
//!   length: the container starts empty and the wire carries the length.
//! * **A repeated id replaces; a re-opened element merges.** Last occurrence
//!   wins per id (§7.4). [`place_elem`] overwrites the slot; [`reserve_elem`]
//!   leaves an existing slot alone, so a struct element framed twice keeps the
//!   fields its first frame set; [`reserve_row`] clears the row.
//! * **A rejected id extends nothing.** The bound is compared *before* the
//!   container grows (§6.2.1: "before the container it indexes into is
//!   extended"), so a rejection leaves it exactly as it was and a lower id
//!   delivered afterwards still lands (§7.2 item 8).
//!
//! # Two bounds, never both
//!
//! An index — and an element length, and a row's element count — carries a
//! schema bound and a receiver cap, and exactly one of the pair applies
//! (CORELIB_PLAN §6.2.1). [`Bound`] makes that a type rule: a value is one or the
//! other, never both and never neither.
//!
//! * [`Bound::Schema`] — the schema declared `count:` / `maxlen:`. A breach
//!   contradicts the schema both peers agreed on: [`Error::InvalidMsg`] (§7.1),
//!   a validity verdict.
//! * [`Bound::Cap`] — the schema declared none, so the receiver's
//!   `max_dyn_array_count` / `max_dyn_string_len` / `max_dyn_blob_len` governs.
//!   A breach is [`Error::LimitExceeded`]: policy on well-formed bytes, which
//!   decode under a looser cap (§6.3).
//!
//! **The cap is passed in, never held.** This module compares against the number
//! it is handed for one call and keeps nothing: it holds no limit of its own,
//! supplies no default, reads no value as *unlimited* and clamps to none
//! (§6.2.1). A cap of `0` states no cap at all — a declared cap is at least 1 —
//! so `Bound::Cap(0)` is a caller defect and answers [`Error::Argument`], never
//! [`Error::LimitExceeded`] against a ceiling nobody configured.
//!
//! # The destination: [`SeqVec`]
//!
//! One trait abstracts the container, so the same functions serve a growable
//! `Vec<T>` and a fixed-capacity `heapless::Vec<T, N>` on either profile. The
//! difference between the two is exactly one thing: a fixed container can be
//! **full**. [`SeqVec::grow_to`] therefore reports failure, and a growable
//! container returns `true` unconditionally, which folds away after inlining —
//! the growable build pays nothing for the fixed one's check. A full container
//! is a destination too short for the message, the category
//! [`PayloadAcc`](crate::PayloadAcc) already uses for a payload longer than its
//! buffer: [`Error::Argument`], never a truncated array.
//!
//! Where the implementations come from:
//!
//! * `Vec<T>` — always in `corelib-rs`; behind the `alloc` feature in
//!   `corelib-rs-no-std`. Growth is `Vec`'s own amortised doubling, so a sparse
//!   array does not cost O(n²) copies (ARCHITECTURE §9.5 shape B).
//! * `heapless::Vec<T, N>` — behind the `heapless` feature in both crates.
//!   `grow_to` refuses up front when the target length exceeds `N`, so a refusal
//!   never leaves a partial extension either.
//! * Anything else — implement [`SeqVec`] for it; the functions are generic.
//!
//! # Cost
//!
//! Every function is generic and `#[inline]`, so it is monomorphised into the
//! generated crate. With a literal bound — `Bound::Schema(5)` — the match on the
//! variant and the comparison fold exactly as the literal `id >= 5` the
//! generator used to emit did.
//!
//! # Example
//!
//! A fixed-capacity destination of four `u8` elements, implemented by the
//! caller, filled the way generated code fills a `count: 4` array:
//!
//! ```
//! use sofab::seq::{self, Bound, SeqVec};
//! use sofab::Error;
//!
//! #[derive(Default)]
//! struct Four { slots: [u8; 4], len: usize }
//!
//! impl SeqVec for Four {
//!     type Elem = u8;
//!     fn len(&self) -> usize { self.len }
//!     fn grow_to(&mut self, len: usize) -> bool {
//!         if len > self.slots.len() { return false; }
//!         for s in &mut self.slots[self.len..len] { *s = 0; }
//!         self.len = len;
//!         true
//!     }
//!     fn slot_mut(&mut self, i: usize) -> Option<&mut u8> {
//!         self.slots[..self.len].get_mut(i)
//!     }
//!     fn clear(&mut self) { self.len = 0; }
//! }
//!
//! let mut out = Four::default();
//! // Elements 0 and 2 arrive; 1 was equal to its default and never written.
//! seq::place_elem(&mut out, 0, Bound::Schema(4), 7).unwrap();
//! seq::place_elem(&mut out, 2, Bound::Schema(4), 9).unwrap();
//! assert_eq!(&out.slots[..out.len], &[7, 0, 9]);
//!
//! // Id 4 is past the schema count: INVALID, and nothing grew.
//! assert_eq!(seq::place_elem(&mut out, 4, Bound::Schema(4), 1), Err(Error::InvalidMsg));
//! assert_eq!(out.len(), 3);
//!
//! // The same id against a receiver cap is a policy verdict instead.
//! assert_eq!(seq::check_index(4, Bound::Cap(4)), Err(Error::LimitExceeded));
//! ```
